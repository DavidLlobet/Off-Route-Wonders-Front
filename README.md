Off Route Wonders is a web application that I have developed as the final project of the Fullstack Development bootcamp that I have carried out at ISDI Coders. This web application functions as a shared travel blog where adventurous travelers can post unique and hidden wonder places they find when traveling around the world.

The first version of Off Route Wonders was developed using React with redux for the frontend and mongoDB and express for the backend. I am very proud of what I have achieved by creating this web application and I am looking forward to continuing this project and many others that I hope to work on from now on!
